Requirements:
    - python-imaging (for PIL)
      On Debian: $ aptitude install python-imaging

Installation:
    1. As root:
        $ mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/thumble
    2. Copy all files into /usr/local/bin/thumble
    3. Open a terminal and run the thumble command with
       a source directory where the fullsized images are
       stored, and a destination directory where you want
       the thumbnail gallery to be stored, e.g.:
        $ thumble ~/images/wallpapers ~/documents/gallery
       
       By default, thumble creates 100px wide thumbnails.
       You can use a different width for your thumbnails, e.g.:
        $ thumble ~/images/wallpapers ~/documents/gallery -w 180
       
       Open index.html from the gallery directory, to view the
       thumbnail gallery.

Feedback:
    Any type of helpful feedback is always welcome. You can also
    come see me on identi.ca: http://identi.ca/jargon, or send me
    and email to jargonsummary@googlemail.com. I'm also on IRC in the
    Python channel on freenode. My nick is jargon-.

Credits:
    A big thank you to all the patient and help and education I get
    from all the wonderful people on IRC in #python and on the Python
    Tutor mailing list (tutor@python.org). Most of what I know
    about Python I've learned from them.
